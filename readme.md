ðŸ¤– AI Smart Shopper Agent
Welcome to the AI Smart Shopper Agent, an intelligent application designed to revolutionize your online shopping experience!

Leveraging the power of AI Agents and large language models, this project creates a personalized shopping assistant that goes beyond simple price tracking. Our agent integrates directly with your financial data to understand your budget and spending preferences, then actively searches the web to find and purchase the products you desire at prices tailored to your financial capacity.

Built with a focus on smart decision-making and automated execution, the AI Smart Shopper Agent aims to save you time and money by making informed purchasing decisions on your behalf. Just tell it what you need, and let your agent do the rest!---
